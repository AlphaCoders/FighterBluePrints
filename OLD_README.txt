Coding Standards

CamelCase : Class Names
Each word should have only the first character capital
Ex: class MakeWorld

pascalCase : methods and variables
First word should be in lower case and other words should have their first character capital
Ex: getFighterDetails

Use #region <regionname> and #endregion to segregate the class code
