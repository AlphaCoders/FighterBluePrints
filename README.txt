Collaboration Standards

Never edit master branch directly
Edit your respective branch and create pull request
Discussion is held before merging into master
If you edit master directly then the old branches get into merge conflicts
If you create pull request then it is easy to revert the merge

Coding Standards

CamelCase : Class Names
Each word should have only the first character capital
Ex: class MakeWorld

pascalCase : methods and variables
First word should be in lower case and other words should have their first character capital
Ex: getFighterDetails

Use #region <regionname> and #endregion to segregate the class code
